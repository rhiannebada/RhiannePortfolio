                the item, it will result as a failed task. Additionally, the game features various rooms where
                each serves as a distinct environment for the player to explore. Despite the game's simplicity,
                it aims to engage players through decision-making.<br><br>

            <div class="description">This non-linear story project aimed to tell an interesting story in a creative and
                interactive way. I have combined audios with text on screen allowing users to make choices to shape the story.
                The concept and goal were to make the audience feel connected to the narrative and let them have a say in how
                it unfolds. <br><br> In the process of making this project, the challenge was to make sure both audio and
                visual parts are aligned to make the interactive features smooth and easy for users. The best parts, in my
                opinion, are when the audio and visuals indeed match perfectly; it makes the story more emotional and engaging.
                Also, I have added a feature where users can go back and change their choices without the need to finish the
                whole story, which I believe improves user experience as there are more areas for exploration and challenges
                critical thinking. Additionally, with the intention to make my work unique, I've refrained from using AI
                generated images and manually drew each page instead. Although this took more of my time, the results are
                worth the effort. <br><br>
